# Chaos Lab Database Tutorial

This tutorial introduces the database infrastructure for the Chaos Laboratory. The figure below illustrates the current infrastructure of our laboratory. We have two databases installed in our laboratory. One is hosted in our lab (development environment) and the other is hosted on the Princeton OIT server (production environment). We are running a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">Postgresql</a>-base setup. We are particularly using this setup (<a href="https://chenkianwee.github.io/masa3db/docs/010/010intro.html" target="_blank">Masa3DB</a>). It uses a set of open-source software: PostgreSQL Database, FROST-Server, TimescaleDB, Postgis and 3DCityDB.
